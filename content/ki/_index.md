Ki is a tree package based on the `Ki` interface implemented by the `Node` struct, supporting arbitrarily directed structural trees and standard operations on them, for primary use in constructing the scenegraph in the [Gi](/gi) GUI framework.  It can also be used for representing file system trees, web DOM trees, or any other such structural tree, which are so commonly used to represent structured information.
