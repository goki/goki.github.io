[GoKi](https://github.com/goki/ki) is a tree package based on the `Ki` interface implemented by the `Node` struct, supporting arbitrary directed (no loops!) structural trees and standard operations thereon, for primary use in constructing the scenegraph in the GoGi GUI framework.  It can also be used for representing file system trees, web DOM trees, or any other such structural tree, which are so commonly used to represent structured information.

[GoGi](https://github.com/goki/gi) is a 2D and 3D GUI framework, built on GoKi, providing a fully native Go experience, built upon widely-used and familiar standards in the web (CSS-based styling and layout, SVG-based vector graphics) and other GUIs (e.g., the Qt Widget and model-view framework).
